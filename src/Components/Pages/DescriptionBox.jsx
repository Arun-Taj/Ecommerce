              E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods and services via digital networksâ€”most notably the Internet. It encompasses various models such as business-to-consumer (B2C), where online retailers sell directly to consumers; business-to-business (B2B), which involves transactions between companies; and even consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platforms that facilitate person-to-person sales.

              In short, e-commerce is the process of buying and selling goods or services online using digital technology. It allows people to shop online, make secure payments, and have products delivered directly to their door.
